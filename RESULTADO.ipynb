    "# Project: Sales Pitch Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name of the project folder:** sales_meeting_preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a **multi-agent, multi-model CrewAI application** designed to assist consultants in preparing for B2B sales meetings. By inputting the name of a potential client and their company, the system autonomously conducts research and generates a comprehensive, markdown-formatted report, ideal for a 30-minute sales call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What It Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inputs**: Name of the target executive (e.g., “Marc Benioff”) and their company (e.g., “Salesforce”).\n",
    "2. **Agent Collaboration**: A team of specialized AI agents performs:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Company research**\n",
    "   * **Executive profiling**\n",
    "   * **Sales pitch generation**\n",
    "   * **Final report composition**\n",
    "3. **Output**: A well-structured markdown report, printed to the terminal and saved to a file, ready for the sales team.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Technical Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Utilizes the CrewAI framework with a sequential process, ensuring agents build upon each other's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modular Design**: Agents and tasks are configured via clean, reusable YAML files for clarity and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Real-Time Web Intelligence**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Employs the `WebsiteSearchTool` to perform live web searches, retrieving relevant documents to provide up-to-date information. RAG enhances the model's responses by incorporating external data sources, ensuring accuracy and relevance.\n",
    "  * **Web Scraping**: Uses the `ScrapeWebsiteTool` to extract specific information from targeted web pages, such as a company's official website. This method allows for precise data collection from known sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-Model Architecture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **OpenAI’s `gpt-4o-mini`**: Handles general reasoning and content generation tasks.\n",
    "  * **Groq’s hosted `LLaMA 3.3 70B`**: Utilized by certain agents for high-performance tasks, demonstrating the orchestration of multiple LLMs within a single Crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Output Handling**: Generates a markdown-formatted document, suitable for briefing consultants effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Value\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand how to orchestrate **multiple LLMs** across different agents.\n",
    "* Explore the integration of **RAG and web scraping** techniques to enhance LLM outputs.\n",
    "* Learn proper **agent specialization**, task linking, and structured output formatting.\n",
    "* Gain hands-on experience with **external data tools**, modular YAML configuration, and output persistence."

    "## Understanding `crew.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "In a CrewAI project, `crew.py` defines the **main application logic** — how agents are created, which tasks they perform, and how everything is connected to form a complete Crew (multi-agent system).\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is like the **blueprint for your agent team**, defining:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who the agents are (and what tools/models they use)\n",
    "* What tasks they’re assigned\n",
    "* In what order tasks are performed\n",
    "* How the whole thing is executed (via the `crew()` method)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Imports and Model Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task\n",
    "from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, ScrapeWebsiteTool, WebsiteSearchTool\n",
    "groq_llm = \"groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SerperDevTool`: Used for **searching the web** (RAG-style search).\n",
    "* `ScrapeWebsiteTool`: Extracts **full page content** from a specific URL (good for in-depth scraping).\n",
    "* `WebsiteSearchTool`: Searches within a specific website for targeted results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ **Key point**: This app uses **two LLMs** — `gpt-4o-mini` (default) and `LLaMA 3.3` via **Groq**. Agents can be assigned different models based on their role.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Class Definition with `@CrewBase`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@CrewBase\n",
    "class SalesMeetingPreparation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main CrewAI class. It pulls agent and task config from YAML files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml'\n",
    "    tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method decorated with `@agent` returns a configured `Agent` object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@agent\n",
    "def company_research_agent(self) -> Agent:\n",
    "    return Agent(\n",
    "        config=self.agents_config['company_research_agent'],\n",
    "        tools=[SerperDevTool(), ScrapeWebsiteTool()],\n",
    "        llm=groq_llm\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loads the agent config from YAML (`agents.yaml`)\n",
    "* Assigns tools for web search and scraping\n",
    "* Overrides the LLM to use `LLaMA 3.3` via Groq\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is where you specialize your agents. Some agents use tools, some use custom models, and others just use reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `@task` method defines a specific **job** for an agent. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@task\n",
    "def generate_sales_pitch_task(self) -> Task:\n",
    "    return Task(\n",
    "        config=self.tasks_config['generate_sales_pitch'],\n",
    "        agent=self.sales_pitch_strategist_agent(),\n",
    "        context=[\n",
    "            self.research_company_task(),\n",
    "            self.profile_executive_task()\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loads the description and output expectations from `tasks.yaml`\n",
    "* Assigns it to the appropriate agent\n",
    "* **Links the output** of prior tasks (company + executive research) as context\n",
    "\n",
    "> This chaining is critical — it’s how tasks **build on one another**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Crew Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@crew\n",
    "def crew(self) -> Crew:\n",
    "    return Crew(\n",
    "        agents=self.agents,\n",
    "        tasks=self.tasks,\n",
    "        process=Process.sequential,\n",
    "        verbose=True\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings everything together:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All agents and tasks are registered.\n",
    "* The process is **sequential**, meaning each task runs **in order**, passing its results forward.\n",
    "* `verbose=True` enables detailed logging for debugging and understanding agent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to Learn From This File\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to define and configure agents with different tools and models.\n",
    "* How to design tasks that use both `RAG` (web search) and **scraping**.\n",
    "* How to link tasks using the `context` parameter to create multi-step workflows.\n",
    "* How to create a fully functional AI agent crew using only Python and YAML — no hardcoded prompts needed."
